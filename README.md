# FCMHelloworld
FCM helloworld project. Testing notifications when the app is closed(by swiping from recent activity)

## Issues
* There is a major issue of Chinese phones changing the OS to kill apps(services,alarms,FCM) when they are closed.
* There is also an issue of messages not getting delivered when users don't pay the OTT(Over-the-top) Tax
* The apps background services, alarms manager, work manager and FCM are killed on chinese phones(Infinix, Techno). This issue is not present on Samsung however
